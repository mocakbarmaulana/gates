                    <b>The forgetting curve exists, but it cannot beat you.</b><br>
                    We did not invent the forgetting curve. Of course, we did not. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a 19th- Century
                    German psychologist, did. In short, it shows the speed at which we forget information if we don’t do
                    anything to retain it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The forgetting curve has been and will still be debated but there is a consensus around its key
                    principles. In the world of skills, this means that whatever you learn will be forgotten if you
                    don’t keep practicing.

                        Ever wondered what #theNewWorkforce is going to look like? Ever wondered what kind of job you
                        are

                    Yesterday’s workforce was very much static. Your academic background and initial professional
                    experiences were leading you into a specific path with very specific skills in very few areas.
                    Forget it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow’s workforce will require you to be agile in the true sense of the word. Evolving within a
                    rapidly changing workplace, you will have to be flexible, adjustable, malleable. Your greatest skill
                    will lie in your ability to learn and relearn.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    Experts predict that the new workforce will be rewarded for skills and abilities. Not its academic
                    diploma, regardless of prestige. Your skills are your greatest asset and the good news is, it is
                    well within your control to grow them!
